in Finance. We provide tools that are designed to increase a persons

communications they receive and send as part of their work.</p>
<p>
	2. Who can sign-up for Finfore? Our registration system is open to any 
person to apply for access to Finfore. However, we look at every 
registration to check that you work in Finance. We reserve the right to 
refuse access at our sole-discretion.We wish to keep Finfore for people 
who are professional investors and therefore have both a greater insight
 into Finance and a greater understanding about the risks in finance. In
 particular we aim to provide a service to individuals that are 
registered with their local financial regulator, e.g. the FSA in the 
United Kingdom.</p>
<p>
	3. Finfore at Work? Our primary customers are financial institutions. We
 provide a services based model, where a company purchases the right to 
install Finfore on its employees' desktops. We then work with their IT 
department to configure the service for each of their employees. This is
 designed to allow scale-deployment. Furthermore, we work with the IT 
department to personalise the service so that each employee starts with a
 customised service that immediate helps increase their efficiency.</p>
<p>
	4. Finfore on my Mobile? Currently we have a desktop application only. 
We are developing a Blackberry, Android and an iPhone application. This 
shall be available later in 2010.</p>
<p>
	5. Who is Finfore? Finfore is a private company limited by shares, based
 in London, United Kingdom. Finfore was founded in early 2010. If you 
would like to receive more information or arrange a meeting or interview
 with Finfore, please send us an email at info@finfore.net.</p>
<p>
	6. Working for Finfore? Finfore is a start-up business. If you would 
like to be considered for a staff position when they become available, 
please send us your details at info@finfore.net.</p>
<p>
	7. When will you launch other languages? Later this year we expect to 
launch services in Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Hindi, Italian, 
Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish. We are focusing on 
the most popular languages used on the Internet. As our service builds 
we'll roll-out services in more languages.</p>
<p>
	8. Improving our service? Technology, the Internet, and hopefully 
people are constantly changing for the better. We at Finfore want to 
improve our service and make the experience a better one. If you have 
suggestions on ways we can keep ahead of the crowd, please send an email
 to info@finfore.net.</p>
<p>
	9. What if I see something offensive? If you see something offensive 
when using our service, no matter how brief or limited, we hope you 
contact us immediately at info@finfore.net.</p>
<p>
	10. Does Finfore mean something special? Sadly no. Finding a great name 
that hasn't already been registered by someone else can be difficult. 
Buying one can be expensive. As a result, we took the work "financial" 
and "forecasts" and put them together for Finfore.</p>
